They're very good.</p><p>Why can't everything be a taco? We're going to attempt that here, turning every word we find into the taco bell recipe with each ingredient.</p><p>We want to input a word as a string, and return a list representing that word as a taco.</p><p><em><strong>Key</strong></em></p><p>all vowels (except 'y') = beef</p><p>t = tomato</p><p>l = lettuce</p><p>c = cheese</p><p>g = guacamole</p><p>s = salsa</p><p><em><strong>NOTE</strong></em><br>We do not care about case here. 'S' is therefore equivalent to 's' in our taco.</p><p>Ignore all other letters; we don't want our taco uneccesarily clustered or else it will be too difficult to eat.</p><p>Note that no matter what ingredients are passed, our taco will always have a shell.</p>
