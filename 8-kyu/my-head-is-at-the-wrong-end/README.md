Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!</p><p>Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).</p><p>Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics</p><p>Simples!</p>
